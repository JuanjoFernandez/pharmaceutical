## The project consists of analyzing data about test results of a new cancer drug on mice by a pharmaceutical company. 

# **Overview**

- The analysis will be done using pandas jupyter notebook
- Python libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, scipy

# **Progress Tracker**

### *04/14/2021*
- Created readme
- Calculations on [pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb](Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb)
- Checked mouse_metadata for duplicated ID's none found
- Found some duplicated data for the tests results
- Found and displayed the duplicated data
    - Only one mouse is duplicated and only for some timepoints
    - Tumor size differs slightly, probably was measured by 2 scientists, will keep the last value
- Dropped the duplicated data
- Added header to readme

### *04/15/2021
- Updated comments
- Tumor volume statistics table

### *04/16/2021
- Fixed SEM, now it is computed using Scipy
- Tumor volume table repeated using aggregate method

### *04/19/2021
- Plotted measurements by drug regimen using both pandas and pyplot
- Pie chart of mouse sex distribution using both pandas and pyplot
- Created new table with final tumor volume
- Determined outliers by quantitative method
